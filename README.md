# social-network-API
This repository contains the code for the backend of a social network site. It has the CRUD API structure in place for Users and Thoughts. As well as the ability to add Friends to users and Reactions to thoughts. 
## Description
This challenge asked us to build APIs for a social networking site, where one can add Users, Thoughts, build a Friends list, and add reactions to thoughts. This tested our ability to use MongoDB and mongoose. Additionally this challenge helped exercise the code structure for Routes, Controllers, and Models. 

## Additional Information
### Notes
The more practice writing APIs the easier it gets. They actually get a little repetitive with the .then statements. The trickiest part is figuring out what action you need to take from Mongoose's vast array of options. Using $pull and $push seems like just the tip of the iceberg.
